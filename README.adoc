= Online jOOQ REPL

This project contains a web REPL to perform https://www.jooq.org/[jOOQ]
queries. It is currently a work in progress so expect papercuts. I currently
have no idea where this project is going, all the current features either serve
my needs or were fun to program :P

== Quickstart with Docker Compose

Clone this directory to a machine that has Docker Compose installed and 
run this command in the project's root directory:

----
docker-compose up 
----

(when you're running this for the first time, it may take a while while
Docker and Gradle download all the dependencies)

Then, point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and try executing some
queries. Try `jooq.selectFrom(FILM).fetch()` for example. Take a look at
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-structure.html[the Sakila schema]
to get more ideas about queries to try. Look up 
https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual-single-page[jOOQ's documentation] if
you can't get a query to work.

You can also try playing with the `docker-compose.yaml` file if you want to
add additional RDBMS engines - MySQL should be simple. As for supporting
database schemas other than Sakila, you can either provide your own jOOQ
model or <<generating-jooq-model,generate one on the fly>>.

Note that if you can't get your changes to show up despite restarting
docker-compose, the nuclear approach seems to be `docker-compose up -V 
--build`.

=== Can I bring my own database?

Yes! Just read on - in fact, one of the main reasons I built this project was
to have a jOOQ REPL I could easily attach to my projects using docker-compose
(which I use to set up all my development databases these days).

== The web REPL

The web executor accepts Java scripts and makes it easy to run jOOQ scripts
on them. A `jooq` variable is available for use that contains a connected
https://www.jooq.org/doc/3.11/manual/sql-building/dsl-context[DSLContext].


=== Setup

The following environment variables are available:

REPL_PORT:: The port to which the web application will bind, defaults to 8080
REPL_COMPILE_DEPENDENCIES:: Whitespace-delimited list of Gradle package
coordinates to use when building the REPL
REPL_JOOQ_VERSION:: The jOOQ version to include into the REPL, defaults to
3.11.9
REPL_CSRF_SECRET:: If given, it will be used as a secret seed for CSRF
protection tokens - note that you _have_ to use `127.0.0.1` instead of 
`localhost` when running a local container with CSRF protection! If not given,
no CSRF protection will be applied.

=== Generating the jOOQ model during build

If you don't have a jOOQ model built yet, one can be built during startup. Set
the `GENERATE_JOOQ_PACKAGE` property (see the 
<<_defining_the_available_databases,section>> about configuring databases)
to have the build system make a jOOQ model for you. Also make sure that your
database driver is on the classpath by copying its JAR to the `extra-libs`
directory (you need it for running queries anyway). 

You can even copy the generated model and use it in your own project, though
you should know that it will be built with very generic settings. jOOQ's
schema generator has a wide array of settings with which you can tweak your
model and this project doesn't support them all (even the schema is currently
locked to _public_). Consider Modifying the `build.gradle` file manually if
you don't want to include the model generation into your own build.

=== Extending the classpath

The folder `extra-libs` will be loaded into the same classpath as the snippets.
Your existing jOOQ models and database drivers are excellent candidates -
copy their JARs into this folder or mount them in your docker-compose files.

=== Adding your own source files

Any source files copied into the `extra-source-files` will be compiled together
with the REPL source files. A good use of this would be to make your jOOQ
source models available even if you don't compile them into a separate JAR.

Make sure your directory structure continues to mirror Java's
directory-per-package convention. For example, to include source files from
the `org.example.model` package only, the corresponding docker-compose volume
instruction would be 
`./src/main/java/org/example/model:/usr/src/webapp/extra-source-files/org/example/model`.

=== Adding your own dependencies

If your source files require additional dependencies, it is possible to include
them using the `REPL_COMPILE_DEPENDENCIES` environment variable. It will
separate individual dependencies by splitting them any whitespace character - 
newlines work pretty good in a docker compose YAML file.


== Database connections

=== Setup

The application must be told about the databases at its disposal using
environment variables. On startup, the application will look for any 
environment variables of the form `DATABASE_<unique_database_key>_URL` (where
`unique_database_key` is any valid environment variable name).

This property must contain a connection string that can be used by JDBC. In
addition to it several more properties can be defined using the same prefix but 
replacing `URL` another key. These keys are:

URL:: the connection string to use when connecting to the database
DESCRIPTION:: the text to be shown for this connection on the user interface
USER:: the username to use when connecting to this database
PASSWORD:: the password to use when connecting to this database
GENERATE_JOOQ_PACKAGE:: if present and not blank, a jOOQ schema will be
generated with this value as its package name
SCRIPT_PREFIX:: text to automatically inject before any user scripts, use it to
provide common imports or anything else that will make the users' life easier.
By default, `import org.jooq.impl.DSL` and 
`import static org.jooq.impl.DSL.*;` will be prefixed;

For example, to define a database using the key 'OLD_POSTGRES' one could use
environment variables named `DATABASE_OLD_POSTGRES_DESCRIPTION`, 
`DATABASE_OLD_POSTGRES_URL`, `DATABASE_OLD_POSTGRES_USER`,
`DATABASE_OLD_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
