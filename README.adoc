== Defining the available databases

The application must be told about the databases at its disposal using
environment variables. On startup, the application will look for any 
environment variables of the form `DATABASE_<unique_database_key>_URL` (where
`unique_database_key` is any valid environment variable name).

This property must contain a connection string that can be used by JDBC. In
addition to it several more properties can be defined using the same prefix
but replacing `URL` with:

DESCRIPTION:: the text to be shown for this connection on the user interface
USER:: the username to use when connecting to this database
PASSWORD:: the password to use when connecting to this database

For example, to define a database using the key 'OLD_POSTGRES' one could use
environment variables named `DATABASE_OLD_POSTGRES_DESCRIPTION`, 
`DATABASE_OLD_POSTGRES_URL`, `DATABASE_OLD_POSTGRES_USER` and
`DATABASE_OLD_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
